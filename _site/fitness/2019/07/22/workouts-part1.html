    <p>The first step in figuring out how to create a workout plan is figuring out what your goals are. A workout plan for building size is rather different than one for losing weight or for building strength.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons is that our muscles grow differently under different types of tension.
Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is the process in which we build size through increasing the amount of sarcoplasm which is a non-contractive fluid.
Myofibril hypertrophy is the process in which we build strength by strengthening the myofibril which is what contracts your muscles
Transient hypertrophy is the temporary increase in muscle size through fluid accumulation which many gym goers refer to as “the pump”</p>

<p>And this affects our workout plan because different rep ranges are associated with different types of hypertrophy. For those of you who don’t know, “reps” is short for repetitions, in other words: how many times are we doing this movement in a row? So if we did 10 pushups in a row, took a break and then another 10 in a row, then we did 2 sets of 10 reps.</p>

<p>If we are looking to build size, we would prefer to stick to the 8-12 rep range. For building strength, we would stick to 1-5 reps. For cardiovascular health/muscular endurance we would do 12-20 reps. Of course, this isn’t set in stone. Obviously you’ll still build strength if you do your exercises in the 8-12 rep range as the weight that you are using gets easier for you. Likewise as your muscles break down in the 1-5 rep range, you’ll increase in size. But these rep ranges are a good way to prioritize and focus on your goals.</p>

<p>The other very important aspect is nutrition. If you’re looking to add size as your primary focus, then you have to eat a caloric surplus. If you’re looking to lose weight, then a caloric deficit is a must. Strength training is important for both. It’s pretty clear how it can help in adding size, but the reason strength training is important even if your primary focus is losing weight is that in the process of having a caloric deficit, you will lose muscle as well as fat and water weight. The way to prevent losing muscle (or losing as much muscle) is to do strength training. It’s also a good way to burn extra calories to create or enhance that caloric deficit and it helps you burn more calories because it requires energy to rebuild muscle after it has been broken down.</p>

<p>Now that we know how many reps we might want to use, how many sets should we have? The general rule is 3-5 sets of each exercise not counting warm up sets. We should also try to limit the number of sets per workout to 15-25. The reason we want to do this is first and foremost we don’t want to spend hours and hours at the gym each day. There’s a limit to our concentration and if there are too many sets in the workout, it just becomes less effective at the end.</p>

<p>We want to rest in between sets to allow for some recovery and getting rid of the waste buildup in our muscles in order to complete our next set. For sets of 1-3 reps (strength/power), we want to allow for 3-5 minutes of rest in between. We want a long recovery time to ensure we are back at full strength for these heavy sessions. In the 4-7 rep range (strength), we want a 2-3 minute rest. In the 8-12 rep range (size/strength), a 1-2 minute rest. And if we are going beyond 12, then just enough rest to complete the next (long) set. It’s perfectly okay to adjust these rest times based on how you feel. They are general guidelines and if you feel like you need more rest to complete your next set, then you should take that extra rest to prevent injury.</p>

<p>Now that we know how many sets and reps we should have per workout, how many sessions should we have per week? A lot of this is dependent on your schedule but generally people go to the gym 3-4 times a week. As long as you keep 48 hours between training the same muscle group, you should have adequate time to recover. Some popular training splits are: full body 3-5 days a week with a different focus each session, push/pull/legs twice a week, or upper/lower twice a week.</p>

<p>Now that we discussed how to structure our training, what exercises should we do? The important aspect here is to hit all the major body parts.
In the lower body, we have the quads in the front, glutes (butt) and hamstring in the back and the calves. In the upper body we have the “pushing” muscles (shoulder, chest, and triceps) and the “pulling” muscles (back and biceps). And finally, in the middle, we have the core (abs and lower back).</p>

<p>Some basic exercises to include are: squats for the quads, deadlifts and hip thrusts for the glutes and hamstrings, calf raises for the calves, bench press and overhead press for the push muscles, pull ups and rows for the pull muscles and planks and crunches for the core.</p>
