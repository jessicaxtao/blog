Last month was the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots and with that came a particularly
big push from many different companies to show their commitment...and also to make some money.
It is not a bad thing that many of these giant corporations that previously would never
have been associated with LGBT+ rights is now actively embracing and trying to
emphasize their inclusive policies etc. Some people might argue that it's too little, too late
and I wouldn't mind the support if it didn't seem so fake. For example, there are 9 companies that
all claim to support LGBT+ rights and have super inclusive policies (scoring a perfect score on one
Human Rights Campaign list) and yet together they have given more than $15 million to the most
anti-LGBT+ politicians around. So really, it's about making as much money as possible, whether
it's off the LGBT+ population or from friendly deals from anti-LGBT+ politicians. It's not the people
who matter, it's the money. Studies have shown that people are willing to pay more for a product from
a place they perceive as LGBT+ friendly than from a place they view as anti-LGBT+. Isn't that the
real reason these companies are displaying the rainbow flag?

Another major issue that I have is that the commercialization of pride masks many of the problems
LGBT+ people still face, even in places like NYC. Of course Pride should be a happy, celebratory
event where people can feel pride for being who they are and to celebrate the advances that has
occurred over the last 50 years (although perhaps not so much in the past year). But the corporate
nature of pride has changed the narrative to celebrate the stereotypical, dual income, childless
couple who have the ability to spend money and travel and partake in this consumerism. This masks
the problem that LGBT+ people are far more likely to fall into poverty than their straight cis-gendered
peers. I am not at all complaining about individual companies who support Pride and LGBT+ people, but
the aggregate effect of virtually every giant corporation in America doing so, means that Pride
*is* money.

There's a guy who tried to argue for the commercialization of pride and how it's not necessarily a bad thing.
Here's a link for those interested: https://fee.org/articles/why-the-commercialization-of-pride-month-is-not-a-bad-thing/. He has some silly argument about how the commercialization of Christmas was scary for the Christians too. But um...hello do you realize how many non-Christians celebrate Christmas? The commercialization of Christmas *did* devalue the religious aspect of the holiday.
He also claims that "The commercial items at Target and Nordstrom, however, will at least give you options while you plan a partyâ€”or a brunch (on your own behalf)". But that's not the point! The point isn't that
it's easier to buy these products or whether or not these products are useful in society. The point is that
these big corporations are profit-seeking off of people's pain. If we argue that straight parades shouldn't
exist, and that straight people should be glad that they don't exist, then pride parade is really about the
difficulties that LGBT+ people have faced in the past and continue to face. In that case, in the same way
that we protest when people sell photographs/videos of tragic events etc. we should also protest when
big corporations, particularly the ones who aren't true allies, make money off of other people's difficulty.

One last thing: I also believe that Taylor Swift's song is tone-deaf at best. And the mainstream nature of
pride makes me feel rather unrepresented.

I know I'm a little late with this post, sorry about that. I also didn't fully edit or proofread
and this is definitely very rushed writing. In the future, I will also be sure to add sources.
