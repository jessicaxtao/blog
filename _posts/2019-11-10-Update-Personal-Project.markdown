For the past few months, I have been (slowly) working on a side project to produce my own set of playing cards. I started collecting playing cards a while back and as someone interested in design and art, I thought that this would be a fun project. It’s come to a bit of a standstill recently because of just how busy life has gotten but I would really like to get it done before Christmas time so here’s a progress update.

<img src = "../../../../assets/img/10spadeswhite.png" width = "40%" height = "auto">

I have the 4 suits completed but haven't yet decided what font to use for the numbers or which color scheme
I'm going to be sticking with. I'm still in the sketching phase of the back design and face cards but am working digitally on the Aces.
