For the past few months, I have been (slowly) working on a side project to produce my own set of playing cards. I started collecting playing cards a while back and as someone interested in design and art, I thought that this would be a fun project. It’s come to a bit of a standstill recently because of just how busy life has gotten but I would really like to get it done before Christmas time so here’s a progress update.
