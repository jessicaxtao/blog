1. A quote to ponder especially as we continue to deal with social distancing. Personally, I advocate for spending at least some amount of time walking alone and with no music or podcasts or anything. I think having music or podcasts on kind of interferes with just spending time with your own thoughts and I do think that's important. “Above all, do not lose your desire to walk: Every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it.” - Soren Kierkegaard 

2. [http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html](http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html) - Paul Graham's an interesting guy and he also cited one of my current professors in this article. I definitely don't agree with everything that he says and he's also purposefully vague here. I'm sure that if he did talk details, I would be more inclined to disagree with him. But free speech in universities is a salient topic right now and on a more personal front, I hope that I never conform to the thoughts and opinions of the public and continue to consider carefully the arguments of intelligent people that I don't agree with.
