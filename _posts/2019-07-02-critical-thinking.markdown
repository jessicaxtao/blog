This piece is definitely going to be a difficult one to write. I'm a big fan of
this philosophy/literary blog called "Brain Pickings". In this blog, the author
has already touched on critical thinking far better than I could ever hope to.
She speaks about Descarte's 12 Rules of Critical Thinking not to mention the views
of Buddha, Galileo, Carl Sagan and so many others. Instead, I'm going to explore
the idea of critical thinking about how it relates to the way intelligent people
can fall for false news.
