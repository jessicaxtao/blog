The importance of critical thinking is often lauded in schools, the workplace and general society.
It's in the important list of skills in the Common Core Standards and so many other lists of skills that
students should come out of school having. The definition of critical thinking is certainly wide ranging
but I consider it to be the type of thinking that we do aimed at finding the truth. It's a difficult skill to work on in school. I mean oftentimes we just find it annoying when someone asks a lot of questions clearly trying to challenge the teacher. But we should praise difficult questions because they help us evaluate our thinking. If we cannot defend our thinking, we should not rely on intuition or past knowledge and instead either come up with a defense or change our thinking. Believing authoritative figures is how myths get perpetuated. Our great willingness to defend our beliefs even when we have no defense, is what holds us back from growing.

And this is especially scary on the Internet. So much false information that people aren't willing to do the basic fact check on. And people are so defensive about positions that are even slightly different. I mean my parents and grandparents believe the world to be very differently than I do. And yes, of course there are differences in values etc. but the main reason is that they get all of their news from Chinese newspapers and WeChat. And it's so frustrating how powerful the backfire effect is. The more I argue with them, especially with a small language barrier, the more entrenched in their beliefs they become.

I also have the same thoughts about people whose worldview **are** similar to mine. There's the people I call "New York Times Liberal" - I can't complain about them too much because their worldview is at the end of the day quite similar to mine. But they hold the most boring and safe view every time. I mean the opinion section of the NYTimes is way less interesting than those of similar reputable news sources. And I love the NYTimes! But I love it for its fast reporting that I can trust (with verification) and giving me a good base point to jump off and explore topics in more depth. Anyway, the problem with the NYTimes Liberal isn't their boring views, it's the fact that they get their boring views by mindlessly consuming some news and not critically thinking and finding their own opinion. For so many of my peers, they'll spend hours reading the news on NYTimes but nothing else and all that does is confirm the beliefs that they already hold, and give a very mainstream boring view on whatever new political issue that has come up. It's just another example of people learning by rote memorization.
