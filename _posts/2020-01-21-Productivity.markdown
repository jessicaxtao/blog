I’ve really enjoyed listening to podcasts like Tim Ferriss’s and hearing/reading about the workflows of various people so I thought I would write one of my own. 

A Goal List - I have a sheet of paper that is on display and visible from my desk so that I constantly see it. The goal list is basically the same as the goals I have listed on <a href=”https://jessicaxtao.github.io/blog/goals”>this site</a>. I like having the accountability of people being able to see it here but seeing it all the time when I sit at my desk is huge for me. The goal list is very vague and the next three tools that I use are meant to break these goals down into something a little more actionable.

Done - I am using Done, the iPhone app, to quickly keep track of the number of podcasts that I listen to or times I go to the gym in order to more easily add up for the percentages on my goal list. It’s a really simple interface and I think it is effective at what it does.

Todoist - Every time I have a new idea, it goes into Todoist. I’ve got a few lists that have projects that I will likely not work on for a long time but I still want to note down somewhere and every quarter or so I’ll go and delete the ones I no longer have interest in doing or bump the priority on certain projects I do want to start working on. I really like how quickly I can note something down in Todoist, especially because of its excellent natural language processing. I have really liked a few others that had more free features but the natural language processing of Todoist is unbeatable and so I keep coming back.

Other than that, Todoist also houses all of the things I need to complete whether it be for school, work or personal life. In the beginning of the semester I would go ahead and put in every deadline that I know about from the syllabus of my classes.

Whiteboard - On my whiteboard I have the projects that I would like to complete this week, also for the visibility. While I check things off on Todoist, the whiteboard is a reminder of what I need to be working on when I’m procrastinating at my desk. I generally use 3 colors - black for must do, blue for would like to complete, and green for if I have time. The whiteboard works together with Todoist because I will start off my week on Sunday going through Todoist to make sure I’m not missing anything I need to do and write those on my whiteboard.

Notion - Then from the whiteboard list of things, I will sort out what I need to accomplish by day in my Weekly Agenda in Notion. I have a lot of weekly psets and thus on my weekly agenda in Notion I might list the pset under Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday because I will be working on it on multiple days etc. Notion is also the home to a lot of my project planning and lists. I have my reading list in Notion, my writing/editing/publishing schedule for this blog, and even my class notes.

Drive - While most of my short form writing is housed in Notion, Google Drive is still home to long form writing. If I’m writing an essay that will be longer than 2-3 pages, it’s definitely going into Drive.

Google Calendar - On the daily side of things, I like to time block my day. Google Calendar will have my practice schedule and class schedule right in the beginning of the semester and afterward I will be able to plan out my day and block out little blocks of time where I might be able to get work done. I have a coloring system for this too, using red for extracurriculars, green for classes, purple for work and blue for personal events. Then I use yellow blocks for time I have planned to be doing certain things but where the timing isn’t mandatory. For example, if I’m meeting up with a friend for something then it’ll be in blue because I must show up at that time while “study for this class” might be in yellow because that’s more flexible.
