## Microsoft Rewards

Microsoft Rewards gives you points for searching on Bing. Once you reach level 2 (there are only two levels), you can get 150 points for searching on your computer and 100 on mobile with an additional 20 points for using Microsoft Edge. For each search, you receive 5 points.

There are additional ways to earn points including a daily quiz, poll, and search which combined will give you 50 points per day. If you maintain a streak, you will get additional points (45 points after completing a 3-day streak, and if you go for 4 more days after that you get 75 points).

Rewards include gift cards to establishments like Starbucks, Microsoft’s own store, AMC Theatres, Target, Walmart, the NFL shop and some other stores. $5 gift cards are 6500 points.

### Pros:
Not a ton of maintenance (~50 searches a day). Any search that isn’t a repeat counts so most days I’ll just search 1, 2, 3,...etc until I get my points or type in gibberish.
Relatively quick rewards - ~20 days of searching would get you a $5 gift card so if you really maintained it you could get $90 a year.

### Cons:
The gift card selection is lacking. There are no Amazon gift cards and no way to cash out. But if you frequent Starbucks or go to the movies, which would be most people, there are still good options for you.

## Sweatcoin

Sweatcoin is an app that rewards you for walking by tracking your outdoor steps (so walking around at home/on a treadmill etc. will not count). By default, you can only earn 5 sweatcoin a day but you are able to upgrade by using the sweatcoins you have earned. To upgrade to earning 10 sweatcoin a day, you would need to pay 4.75 sweatcoins per month.

It takes about 1200 outdoor steps to earn one sweatcoin. For context, people average 2000 steps per mile. If you walked 5 miles a day/10,000 steps a day, you would earn about 8.3 sweatcoins a day. Since that requires the 10 sweatcoin level, each month you would earn 240-250 sweatcoins.

There is a rotating list of rewards. Right now this includes workout tops from YogaClub (900 sweatcoins), a trial set of razors (10 sweatcoins), one month of automatic notes from Otter (6 sweatcoins), weight loss challenge ebook from IdealShape (100 sweatcoins).

The marathon rewards are quite a bit better but are costly - iPhone XS or $1,000 cash for 20,000 sweatcoins.

### Pros:
Relatively low maintenance. You leave the app on in the background and it will automatically track so you don’t have to actively do anything. It’s not a huge battery drain and I don’t really notice it there.
If you are willing to stick with it, the big rewards are really good. Even if it takes you 10 years to get the $1000, you are earning $100 per year. Of course, this assumes that Sweatcoins will remain around for that long, but you’re not really losing anything given that walking outside is presumably something you’re already doing.

### Cons:
It will literally take years to earn big rewards. Assuming you walk 10,000 outdoor steps each day, which most Americans don’t, it will take nearly 7 years for you to earn $1000 or the iPhone. Even if you max out your points (570 sweatcoins per month, 7 sweatcoins every 3 days using the daily bonus), it will still take over 2.6 years to complete and that’s walking 12 miles outside every single day.
The smaller rewards aren’t very good. They’re slow to update the medium-sized rewards (the 6500 sweatcoin wireless headphones have been sold out for a few days but has not yet been updated) and the other medium-sized reward is a skydiving thing. The small rewards are even less appealing because most of the time it’s a one month free from a year-long subscription or X% off a product. There’s no smaller cash-out option.
The daily bonus is iffy. Sometimes I’ll try to watch the ad video in order to get the bonus but it’ll take forever to load before simply telling me there are no ads right now. But I do like that it’s not streak based.

## Lympo

Lympo is another app that rewards you for walking but it does so in the form of challenges. You choose to join certain challenges and then either use the built-in tracker (which will map your path) or connect to Apple’s Health app or whatever your phone uses to track your steps to complete those challenges. Steps expire at the end of the day and each challenge has its own expiration date. Each challenge also has its requirements and rewards so there isn’t a set number of Lympos for steps.

It’s much harder to calculate the earning potential because of the nature of the challenges but I got an email last week saying that I earned more than 55% of Lympo users with my 115 coins that week (I really only walked to and from work and maybe a mile or two on a treadmill). But that means for the average user, it would take nearly 20 years to earn the Samsung S10+. I think the max is somewhere near 140 Lympo per week so it would still take 16 years to earn a phone. The good news is, there are smaller rewards that I find worthwhile. A shirt costs 2000 Lympo so I could get about 3 new shirts a year with average American walking. And the shirts look really good so I’m actually excited about earning them. They also stock gift cards (700 coins for $5) so $5 every 6 weeks or so for the average user.

### Pros:
Uses Apple’s health app so I don’t have to keep this app open for it to calculate steps. Unlike Sweatcoin, indoor steps work as well.
The app is well designed and fun to use. I like the lower rewards that are available because they’re unique and feel attainable.

### Cons:
Requires more maintenance. Because of the fact that steps and challenges both expire, you have to check into the app before 11 AM for the morning challenges, for example. But the steps are automatically syncing if you choose to connect to your phone’s tracker so that means completing challenges is only 2 taps. The challenges are also the same day-to-day so you quickly begin to get into a pattern of knowing which challenges you can complete each day.
The lack of uniformity means that the bigger step goals are a waste of time in terms of Lympo coins. Today’s 4-mile challenge nets you 8.15 Lympo coins while the .61 mile one gets you 3. So one challenge gets you nearly 5 Lympo coins per mile while the other only a measly 2. Even more infuriating the afternoon .61 mile challenge gets you 3 while the evening one gets you 1.17.
Like I mentioned in the description, the bigger rewards are simply unattainable.

Note: They seem to be making some changes though so this information may not be correct in the future.

## Podcoins - no longer available

For every 10 minutues of listening to a podcast, you can earn 1 Podcoin on this app. There are bonus podcasts that allow you to get .5 extra and if you have a streak for longer than 3 days (you maintain the streak by listening for at least ten minutes per day) then you will get another bonus Podcoin every 10 minutes. That means in total you can get 2.5 Podcoins every 10 minutes. I was told that the max per day was 6 hours but I seem to have been able to go past that.

### Pros:
If you already listen to podcasts while going to school/work then this is perfect for you. It will allow you to subscribe to podcasts to save them, download podcasts for offline listening etc. so it has all the basic functionality. However, since it is based on listening time, you cannot speed up the podcast which was a big deal to me since I like podcasts at 1.5x speed.
There’s a number of different gift card rewards: Amazon, DD, Starbucks, AMC, Google Play, Target, Athleta, Uber, and Pottery Barn.

### Cons:
Starting to sound like a broken record but the big rewards are simply unattainable. The Bose QC 35 would take someone 6 hours of listening every single day on a bonus podcast to listen for 3.7 years before getting that reward. If you listened to a podcast you actually like and not one of the bonus ones, it’ll take 4.6 years. And no offense to my little brother but if you’re listening to podcasts for 6 hours every day, then you have a problem. At a much more reasonable 2 hours of listening per day on a non-bonus podcast, it’ll take about 2.3 years to get a $50 gift card. That would be about $20 in gift cards per year. Not terrible but certainly not good. At times when I’m not worried about battery life or anything I just leave bonus podcasts on while my phone is muted. It does ask if you’re still listening after a certain amount of time. Using this and with the caveat that I keep losing my streak so I definitely could’ve done better, I’ve earned about a dollar per month.
The podcast shuts off when you open games and some other apps. Not a major problem but it’s inconvenient. Also inconvienient is that it has a social aspect built in - looking at other people’s listening history, having a leaderboard, a way to follow other users etc. but ....... no way to search for a user. My brother and I literally had to coordinate following a stranger who was high on the leaderboard in order to find each other’s accounts.

Update: Podcoins is no longer available.

## Walgreens

I had a whole thing written and then they went and changed how the rewards worked entirely so this app is to be blamed for the delay in posting this article. There are four week challenges - you can earn 100 per week and do 2 challenges at once (one health related and the other lifestyle related). For example, walk 10,000 steps each day and tracking your spending habits. After successfully completing a four week challenge you get to spin a wheel for more points. Assuming 1000 points on the wheel (I have no idea what the chances are or anything), that’s approximately 2,800 points each month or nearly 3 dollars off your next Walgreens purchase.

### Pros:
I like the challenges because you get to pick and choose the ones that are relevant to you. The walking ones can be automatically tracked so it’s not very difficult to keep up with. And the ones that you have to manually track, you can just log in once a week and check off the days that you did the activity. You do have to remember to do this every week but the time commitment is very low.
This works for Walgreens and Duane Reade and also syncs with the cashback that occurs when you make purchases at these stores. I’m counting this as a pro because these stores are everywhere in New York but obviously if you never shop at Walgreens or Duane Reade this might actually be a con.

### Con:
I’m just generally not a fan of reward systems that have “random” rewards.
The app is really ugly. Some links end up on a PDF-style text and it just doesn’t look good.
In tiny text, I discovered that points do expire! Accounts are deemed inactive if you do not make a purchase in the past six months. Points also expire one year after they are acquired.

## Achievement

This app is pretty much only here because of the fact that it is absolutely 0 maintenance. You get points for walking that it automatically tracks. The amount of points you can earn in a single day is very high (80 points - you get 1 point every ~375 steps, and 6 points for logging activities like food tracking on apps that can be connected). You can cash out when you reach 10,000 points which is $10 on either PayPal or GiftRocket. You can also donate that money. Occasionally surveys and health-related readings will pop up that give you rewards.

### Pros:
No maintenance. Super easy to use.
Connects to 20+ other apps for tracking purposes so no matter what you use, it is probably included.

### Cons:
Not super easy to get to 10 dollars without tracking food etc. (about a year walking 10k steps a day).
