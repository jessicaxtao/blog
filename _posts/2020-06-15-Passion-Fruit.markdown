Passion fruit juice mixed with tea makes for a surprisingly good mixer. It's good on its own or with some vodka.

To make a large batch (filling up a pitcher):

Make a large pot full of tea. Personally, <a href="https://www.portorico.com/store/product228.html">jasmine tea</a> was my favorite but green tea or black tea work as well. My recommendation for black tea is <a href="https://www.portorico.com/store/product213.html">Golden Yunnan</a> and my recommendation for green tea is <a href="https://www.portorico.com/store/product609.html">pinhead gunpowder</a>. Use about a quarter pound of tea leaves. Add the tea leaves after the water is boiling and remove the tea leaves after 3-5 minutes.

Add some ice and lemon juice (about one and a half lemons) to the pitcher. Also make sure to put some water in the freezer/have cold water on hand (about 50 fluid ounces/3 water bottles).

Optional: Add passion fruit syrup (the kind used for passion fruit bubble tea) into the tea.

Caramelize passion fruit juice. Pour enough juice so that it fills up about a third of the pot used for the tea. Boil the juice while stirring continuously. When it becomes difficult to stir, pour this into the tea and mix well. It helps to use a sweet passion fruit juice - we used one that had 27 grams of sugar per 8 fluid ounces (<a href="https://www.instacart.com/products/20418910-sun-tropics-passion-fruit-nectar-64-fl-oz">Suntropics Passion Fruit Nectar</a>).

Pour the tea and caramelized passion fruit juice into the pitcher that contains the ice and lemon juice. Especially if the pitcher is plastic, make sure that the mixture isn't too hot. Pour the cold water in at the same time. Fill up the rest of the pitcher with passion fruit juice. Make sure to mix well (we just use a chopstick to stir).

Taste test this drink. If there is not enough passion fruit flavor, add in more juice or more syrup. If it is not sweet enough (but enough passion fruit flavor) then mix hot water and sugar or some sugar substitute and pour that in.

Alcoholic option: Add in some vodka (about a shot) to a glass of this drink. Drink responsibly!
