I was inspired by this post: <a href="https://daringtolivefully.com/improve-your-life-1000"> Daring To Live Fully </a>
but the basic idea is that we come up with a number of goals and it's kind of
a game to reach "1000% improvement" by the end of the year based on predetermined
criteria.

Here are my 10 goals for the next year and I will be publicly keeping track
in order to help keep myself accountable.

- Improve my rugby
- Designer/artist
- Learn data science
- Be a better programmer
- Run/Gym
- Read
- Podcasts/News/Learn
- Memory
- Blog
- Weight
