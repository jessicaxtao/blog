Overall: 4/5

Halsey's new album, released on Friday January 17th, is the most personal album she's had. That's no surprise for an album that starts with "Ashley" and I am really glad that it's about her story and not just a story. It's also a bit of a change in sound - there's some rock, country, Suga from BTS, a lot of different sounds. While overall I found it catchy and enjoyable, I don't think it has nearly the same replayability as Hopeless Fountain Kingdom. And while she is introspective, I still feel like there's so much she's holding back. If anything, I found her original EP more personal.

One thing that I do love about all of her albums is that I really love the way she orders her songs and really thinks about each song's place in the album.

Favorite Lines from Each Song:

Ashley: "And I don't wanna be somebody in America just fighting the hysteria/I only wanna die some days"

Clementine: "The blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me/And the 808 beat sends your heart to your feet"

Graveyard: "Oh it's funny how/The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies"

You should be sad: This one is one of my favorites, and out of all the songs released before the album, this one was the one that really excited me. It's clearly about G-Eazy and it's personal and just all the things you wish could be said. So relatable and so good. I'm not sure I like all of it - in particular the idea of putting a broken person together, but otherwise great song. "But you're not half the man you think that you are/And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls and cars"

Forever...(is a long time): I liked it but no lyrics stood out to me

Dominic's Interlude: One of my least favorites from this album

I HATE EVERYBODY: This is angsty while being super Halsey. I love the repetition and this felt like it tied together the relationship songs and the personal ones. "Infatuation's observation with a cause/But none of it is love, so while I'm waitin' for it"

3am: Another one of my favorites in this album. "And I'm stumblin' drunk, getting in a car/My insecurities are hurtin' me/Somebody please come and flirt with me"

Without Me: I know this song was in the Top 100 for like a solid year but I don't love it.

Finally // beautiful stranger: I mean it's cute but they have literally already broken up sooo

Alanis' Interlude: I really like this one in part because of the story. Halsey asked the person who helped her feel secure in her bisexuality to be featured and Alanis despite being heavily pregnant agreed. "'Cause your p---y is a wonderland"

killing boys: I feel like this song is Halsey's ability to story tell on display and I really like it. "Told me pick my battles and be pickin' 'em wise/But I wanna pick 'em all and I don't wanna decide"

SUGA's Interlude: I'm going to be honest, I don't like music I can't understand. I like lyrics more than I like sound and since I had to look up translations this wasn't my thing. (Yes I'm aware I used to be a Kpop fan but that was in 4th grade).

More: "I sit and I stare at your clothes in the drawer/I cry and my knuckles get sore"

Still Learning: "I'm still learning to love myself"

929: I love this song. The first time I listened to it I literally had to stop and start again from the beginning to fully pay attention. The recanting of her statement, which to me means not lying to oneself, I really loved. I thought this was the perfect song to end with. "And I remember the names of every single kid I've met/But I forget half hte people who I've gotten in bed"
