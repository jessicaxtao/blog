"If you are a person who's having relationships and has emotions and thinks about what it means to be alive and die and be in love, then you love literature." - Issac Gerwitz (curator for the NYPL)

When it was built, the New York Public Library was the largest marble structure ever built in America. The names of the lions outside of the structure are Patience and Fortitude. Patience is on the left and Fortitude on the right (when facing the library). The lions were named by Mayor Laguardia because he thought those were the things needed to get through the Great Depression. The NYPL was actually built a bit before the Great Depression so they were originally nicknamed after Astor and Lenox, the people who founded the library.

The sculptures (above the columns) are allegorical, a stand-in for the fields history, romance, poetry, religion, drama, and philosophy (in that order). In between are commemorative carvings for the Astor Library, Lenox Library (the two founders) and the New York Free Circulating Library, whose collections were consolidated into the NYPL. At the time of his death, Astor was actually the richest American and thus donated $400,000 to create a library. Lenox had similarly created a library using in part his extensive collection of books and manuscripts. But by the late 1800s, funds were running out. A trustee of Tilden (a one-term governor of New York) decided to pool together these libraries  and the Tilden Trust to form the NYPL. Being atop a terrace comes from the European villa traditions and the NYPL spans two blocks. When it opened, it had a million books and 30,000-50,000 people visited on opening day in 1911, including of course the Mayor and Governor but also the President of the United States, Taft.

After entering the building, you will be in Astor Hall. The staircases are to the left and right, not directly in front which is intentional in allowing people to take in the grandeur. Astor Hall is made of 4 acres worth of Vermont white marble. To keep a consolidated feel, the designer of the outside (Hastings) also did much of the decorative work inside. Busts of the architect also appear on the left staircase (this was added afterward, he didn't just commission a bust of himself).

On the second floor you can look down and see Astor Hall as well as some displays on the history of the NYPL. Continuing on to the 3rd Floor, you will arrive at the McGraw Rotunda, which is the most impressive in terms of decorative impact. The entire room is wood (walnut) and plaster, painted as well as marble archways. The ceiling carrying over the room allowing for windows to let in natural light. The painting on the ceiling has clouds to symbolize rising up from the hustle and bustle of the city both physically and metaphorically. The god Prometheus bringing the gift of fire is also meant to represent knoweldge and inspiration. This was done as part of a government program (the WPA) during the Great Depression sponsoring artists. The theme of history of the written word - Moses, a scribe copying text, Gutenberg, Mergenthaler (linotype machine) - is present in the paintings around the room .

Rom 315 - Catalog Room - Beautiful woodwork on the pedestals of the desks that you should check out on Renaissance style oak. In the old days, this would literally be filled with card catalogs which could be sent via pneumatic tube system (some of which can still be seen) into the Rose Main Reading Room.

As you enter the Rose Main Reading Room, there's a John Milton quote. John Milton is heavily featured in the library including in the Salomon Room (Room 316 from the McGraw Rotunda) which is a gallery that displays the library's art as well as a wife-enabled reading room. At the end of the Salomon Room, there is a painting of a blind Milton dictating Paradise Lost to his daughters as he was blind when he wrote it (this story is actually probably a myth).

The ceilings of the Rose Main Reading Room depicts the morning sky. It is one of the largest rooms in the country that has no domes, columns or steel-reinforced walls to support the ceiling. That's pretty cool engineering wise for a room that's almost as large as a football field. Underneath the room is 7 layers of cast iron steel stacks. All the books here are general reference or other very commonly asked for books, 27,000 in number. If you ask a librarian (in the enclosure) for a book, there's an automated trolley system that goes down into the stacks. In order to store more books, they basically have an underground system underneath Bryant Park and stretches all the way to the fountain at Sixth Avenue.  

At the end of the hall is the Brooke Astor Reading Room - the rare books and manuscripts place for researchers (and anyone is allowed to do research which is really cool). It houses a 1455 Gutenberg Bible, first Bible in the New World. The research section contains 45 million items alone. 

In the 3rd floor there are a number of other special collections. 

Pforzheimer collection: The English Romantics aka Shelley and his circle includes stuff like Mary Wollstonecraft's original A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and 400 manuscripts from Mary Shelley. It's a short period of time that this collection covers but it is the most extensive collection of this time period.

Berg collection: first folio of Shakespeare's work (1623). In the corner is a writing table that once belonged to Charles Dickens - legend has it that Mayor Laguardia sat in the chair during the opening of the library and broke the caning. And now no one is allowed to sit there.

Back down to the first floor is the Milstein Division. It's got a lot of genealogy stuff like birth and death records for the city as well as passenger lists, city directories, and census materials. There are political postcards and old NYC maps with landholdings. There's Ellis Island records and Mayflower records. Since I know exactly how my family traces to NYC, the genealogy things don't necessarily interest me but I love the old travel guides to NY. There are wacky ones like where to buy drugs in NYC from 1969 and tons of old NYC photos.

Also on the first floor is the Map Room with about a half-million maps spanning from a tiny world map made in 1525 to many present-day maps and atlases. There's a globe and since most of the visitors have pointed to New York City, that part of the globe is actually worn down. If you look above the computers at this double hemisphere map, you'll see California as an island. There are a lot of old maps that have that and basically all the other ones were just copying this guy. That one is the original. 

If you look at the North-South Hall coming out of the Map Room, the entire hall is made of marble, specifically Pentelic Marble from Greece (same as the Parthenon). There is octagonal coffering in the ceiling and numerous lion's heads throughout the building like above a fountain on this hall. 

Gottesman Hall - modeled after 17th century gates at the Louvre. The Gottesman Hall is an exhibition hall and the ceiling is made of oak.

Periodicals Room - The periodicals room has recent issues of over 200 popular publications as well as thousands of other current and historical publications. Named after DeWitt Wallace, who had spent a lot of time in the NYPL working on his new publication - the Reader's Digest. Around the periodicals room also includes murals of the major publishing enterprises in NY; the paintings were done in the 1980s.

On the ground floor, there's the Bartos Forum, which includes yellow marble from Italy, with the rest being cast iron. It used to be a lending library. Talks and stuff are held here because it's pretty big, ceiling alone is 30 feet high. 

There is also the Children's Room has the original Winne the Pooh and friends. Winnie the Pooh is named after a bear in the London Zoo (Winnie from Winnipeg, Canada where the bear was from). These stuffed animals were made for the kid for his first birthday. Roo is missing after being lost on a family picnic. Around the Children's Room is also murals with famous landmarks from New York City.

South Court Building - 2002 - 6 story glass structure. It's rejecting most of the design elements of the rest of the building - except in the materials used. Same marble from Vermont used on the floor for example. It contains classrooms with computers, auditorium etc. And if you look over the railing, you can see a stone structure - this was the Croton reservoir that was in New York at the time. As New York got bigger, it outgrew the reservoir and in 1895 decided to convert it to library space. If you look up you can see the original exterior of the building as if you were in the original courtyard.
