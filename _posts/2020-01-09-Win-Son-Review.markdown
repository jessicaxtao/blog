I was very excited for the opening of Win Son Bakery given the immense success of Win Son and the fact that
it is so close to home for me. And it looks cool, with a mural of cartoon characters painted around the outside of the building. But ultimately, it was a letdown.

Admittedly, I have been back two more times so clearly there is some appeal. The mochi doughnut ($4) is excellent. It is exactly as chewy as it should be. It is a little too salty for me but the salt counteracts the sugar well. It is excellent but it is also $4 and usually involves a long wait, especially on the weekends. Other bakery items have been decidedly less impressive. The egg tart, a Chinese bakery staple, had an unappealing and heavy crust and a mediocre interior. This, at the price of $4, is simply ridiculous. In Chinatown, there are numerous bakeries that do it better and it would only be 50 cents, maybe a dollar.

The morning bakery items are much better than the dinner ones. The 7:00-2:00 then 5:30-11:00 hours, splitting the day into two parts, feels like it might be artificially crowding the place around 2:00 as people try to make it in time. It gets really busy at certain times and the cashiers are ... less than friendly. For a menu that is as complicated as Win Son's, they neither effectively sell you on certain products or give you succinct answers. And the dinner menu is just entirely not worth.

Soft serve for $9? Ridiculous. I love pineapples, everyone who knows me knows that pineapple soft serve is like a dream come true for me. But this was certainly not worth the price. The chocolate enclosing that comes on top of the soft serve did not complement the pineapple flavor.

Their bag system feels like a gimmick. It is not actually reusable. I suspect that it's recyclable but I'm not even sure. Memorable, but utterly useless. And one last thing that I feel I must complain about is the naming of pineapple buns or bo luo bao as "pollo bao". I am not Taiwanese but a Google search implies that this is unique spelling for Win Son. In a neighborhood that is majority Hispanic, for a restaurant a block away from Avenue of Puerto Rico, I just simply do not understand why they would name it "pollo" which most people would associate with chicken. If that were the actual spelling, then that would just be a miscommunication. But I have never ever seen it spelled like that so it is just an unnecessary cause of confusion.

Forgive me for believing that a place advertised as a Taiwanese bakery and restaurant would have food that tastes like home. Or for believing that such a place would employ Taiwanese pastry chefs at all. The employees looked like they could be part of a movie playing a stereotypical hipster role. The main chefs were "inspired" by Taiwanese cuisine but trained in French-American pastry styles, something that shows. Ultimately, I felt incredibly out of place as an Asian-American there.
