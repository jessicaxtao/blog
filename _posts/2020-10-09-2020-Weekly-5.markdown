It's midterms week this week and I'm still in the middle of recruiting season so life has been pretty busy, unfortunately. Shorter post today but here are the things that I'm doing to not lose my mind entirely/things I hope to be doing after this week is over. 

1. Walking - My step count has really been killed because of remote everything. In an average school day I would've taken 15k-20k steps and now, most days I only need to leave my apartment for the gym. Walking more, and walking more now that it's hoodie season is a big priority for me. On a super similar vein, if I didn't go to the gym I would definitely be losing my mind faster.
2. Video games - I really like simulation games and recently I've been getting into Roller Coaster Tycoon and just going for games that are chill. On my phone, I've been (re)playing Polytopia which is like a simplified version of Civilization. Big fun.
3. Inktober is here again and I feel like this was much more muted this year. The guy who made Inktober has a really cute YouTube channel and seems like a great guy. I'm a little late on it myself but I plan on completing all 31 drawings sometime this month.
