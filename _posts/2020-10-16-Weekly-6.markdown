A really short post because I may or may not have forgotten this week:
I really love the Polytopia game (available on iOS and Android). It's a game that I first played years ago but still genuinely enjoy using. If you're a fan of games like Civilization or other 4X games, this is a great smaller game to play. Each game is only about 30 turns and thus easy to enjoy in a shorter time frame.
